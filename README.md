# Self-Taught-Python
This repo is my personal note when I first learned Python.
It included most of the materials (if not all) you would need to learn Python from an entry level to git expert.
Every python file is built on its own so it doesn't matter which lecture you want to start first.
I hope this study guide is helpful for someone out there.
